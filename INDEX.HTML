<pre style="font-size:14px; color:#301204;"><strong>
Computer hardware includes the physical parts of a computer, such as the central processing unit (CPU), random-access memory (RAM),motherboard,computer data storage,
graphics card, sound card, and computer case. It includes external devices such as a monitor, mouse, keyboard, and speakers.</strong><hr>

<h3 style="color:#471500;"><b>-:- Why maintenance of the hardware is important -:-</b></h3>
<pre style="color:#301204; font-size:14px;"><b>
Hardware maintenance is essential to maximize equipment lifespan, ensure data integrity, and minimize costly downtime by preventing unexpected failures through cleaning, diagnostics, and repairs.
It boosts system performance, reduces long-term repair costs, and ensures compliance with security standards. 

Key reasons for hardware maintenance include:
<ul>
<li>Extended Lifespan: Regular care (e.g., cleaning, replacing worn parts) prevents premature degradation, extending equipment utility by years.</li>
<li>Reduced Downtime and Costs: Predictive maintenance identifies issues before they cause system failures, saving thousands on emergency repairs.</li>
<li>Optimal Performance: Cleaning dust and updating components keeps systems running efficiently, preventing lag and overheating.</li>
<li>Data Security and Integrity: Regular maintenance helps ensure data is not lost due to hardware crashes and keeps systems compliant with security standards.</li>
<li>Improved Efficiency (OEE): As described in industrial contexts (TPM), maintaining equipment ensures higher availability, performance, and quality. </li>
<li>Hardware maintenance is categorized into preventive (regular checkups), predictive (monitoring conditions), and corrective (fixing issues) measures.</li>
</ul></b>
